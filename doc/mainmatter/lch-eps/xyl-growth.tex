Microbial growth of the \eps{} producing strains of the plates \enquote{EPS1} and \enquote{EPS2} was screened in a 96-well format by incubation in \SIml{1.0} SM2 P30 for \SIh{48} at \SIrpm{1000} and \SIdC{30}. $D_{600}$ was measured and \py{xyl_growth_goodgrowth} of \py{xyl_growth_inputno} strains showed $D_{600}$~â‰¥~\num{0.2} and, thus, were deemed as \enquote{growing well}. For well growing cultures, the maximum $D_{600}$ was \py{xyl_growth_d600max} and the median $D_{600}$ was \py{xyl_growth_d600med}. From the \py{xyl_growth_goodgrowth} strains which showed good growth, new 96-well plates called \enquote{Xyl1} and \enquote{Xyl2} were prepared for storage at \SIdC{-80} for subsequent experiments. The plate layouts of these new plates are given in \vref{tbl-xyl-growth-layout-i,tbl-xyl-growth-layout-j}.
