\subsubsection{\LCH{}\label{subsec-mam-chem-lch}}
\LCh{} was supplied by an industrial partner. The \lch{} was prepared from \lcbm{}. Besides a general material safety datasheet no further information on the \lch{} were supplied. The composition of the \lch{} was analysed in-house and is described in detail in \vref{subsec-lch-analyses}.
