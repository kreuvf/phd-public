\subsection{96-Well Inoculation \& Propagation}
An autoclaved 96-pin replicator (BS) was disinfected using \SIpct{80} ethanol, flamed thoroughly, let cool, put back into the ethanol and flamed shortly again. The replicator was submerged into the contents of the wells of the source plate. The wells were homogenized by mixing carefully with the replicator. The replicator was then removed from the source plate and submerged into the contents of the wells of the destination plate. If necessary, complete transfer was facilitated by mixing carefully with the replicator. During all steps, the replicator was handled cautiously in order to avoid contact with the walls of the wells. Alternatively, defined volumes of the source plate were transferred to new plates using multi-channel pipettes. When inoculating from deep-frozen cultures, the replicator was carefully pushed into the frozen broth and subsequently transferred to the destination plate.
