\subsubsection{Modified EPSmax13 Medium}% Jochen's Fungi Medium
\begin{itemize}
	\item Carbon source: as desired (see \vref{tbl-csc})
	\item \ce{KCl} and yeast extract:
		\SIg{1.00} yeast extract and
		\SImg{500} \ce{KCl}
	\item Salt solution (10-fold):
		\SIg{3.00} \ce{NaNO3},
		\SIg{2.00} \ce{K2HPO4},
		\SImg{500} \ce{MgSO4*7H2O},
		\SImg{50.0} \ce{FeSO4*7H2O} and
		\SImg{700} citric acid monohydrate
\end{itemize}
The salt solution was prepared as a sterile stock and stored at room temperature. KCl \& yeast extract and carbon source were autoclaved separately and later mixed under sterile conditions. \SIml{100} salt solution (10-fold) was added to \SIml{900} of C source with KCl \& yeast extract. The original medium was called \enquote{EPSmax13} and contained \SIgpl{40.0} \glc{} as the C source. It was developed for maximum production of \scl{} by \rolf{} \cite{Schmid2008}.
