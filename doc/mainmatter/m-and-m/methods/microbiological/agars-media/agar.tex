\subsubsection{Agar Preparation}
Agar plates were prepared by the addition of \SIpct{1.5} of agar to the medium prior to autoclaving. For media whose components were autoclaved separately, the agar was either autoclaved separately as well or added to one of the components. The component to which the agar was added was chosen based on the reactivity of agar with the component, therefore, the agar was usually added to a sugar or salt(s) solution.

The completed agar solution was poured into petri dishes \cite{Petri1887} under a laminar flow cabinet and openly stacked on each other in a pyramid style to allow faster cooling/solidification and prevent water condensation on the lid of the dishes. After cooling, the dishes were closed, labelled, stacked vertically, bagged and stored at \SIdC{4} in the dark until needed.
