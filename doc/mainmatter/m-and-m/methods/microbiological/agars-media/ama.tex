\subsubsection{AMA Medium}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Nitrogen source \& salts:
		\SIg{5.00} casein peptone,
		\SIg{2.40} \ce{MgSO4*7H2O},
		\SImg{600} \ce{KCl},
		\SIg{1.00} \ce{NaNO3} and
		\SImg{30.0} \ce{NH4Cl}
	\item Carbon source:
		\SIg{15.0} \glc{} and
		\SImg{300} \ce{CaCl2*2H2O}
	\item\SImg{500} \ce{KH2PO4}
	\item Post-autoclaving additives:
		\SIml{2.00} trace elements solution
	\item pH value: \num{6.5}
\end{itemize}
Nitrogen source \& salts were prepared in \SIpct{60} of the final volume, carbon source in \SIpct{20} of the final volume and phosphate in \SIpct{19.8} of the final volume. Nitrogen source \& salts, carbon source and phosphate were autoclaved separately. All autoclaved solutions were mixed under sterile conditions. Post-autoclaving additives were added from sterile stocks. pH was adjusted afterwards.

This medium was developed by Jochen Schmid and is a mix of the Modified Artificial Seawater Medium \cite{CCAP2008} and the Slime Medium (\vpageref{subsec-slime-media}).
