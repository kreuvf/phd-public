\subsection{Cryopreservation}
Cryo-stocks in single vials (CryoPure, SAK) were prepared by adding equal amounts of sterile \SIpct{60} glycerol and microorganism suspension into the vial, e.g. \SIul{750} sterile \SIpct{60} glycerol and \SIul{750} microorganism suspension. % Source: SK 1, p. 202
Cryo-stocks in 96-well format were prepared by pipetting \SIul{50} of sterile \SIpct{60} glycerol into each well first. Subsequently, \SIul{100} of the respective microorganism suspension was added to each well. If the glycerol and the suspension were thoroughly mixed through the addition of the suspension an adhesive aluminium foil was used to seal the plate. Otherwise, the plate was shaken gently by hand to facilitate sufficient mixing. The prepared plates were then stored at \SIdC{-80}.
