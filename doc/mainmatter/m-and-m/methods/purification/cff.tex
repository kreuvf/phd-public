\subsection{Cross-flow Filtration}
Cross-flow filtration was conducted using a membrane pump (SartoJet, SSB) and membranes on the basis of stabilized cellulose derivatives (Hydrosart, SSB) with a pore size of \SIum{0.45} or nominal molecular weight cut-off of \SIkD{100} or \SIkD{10} were used. Feed pressure was monitored using a digital pressure gauge, permeate and retentate pressures were monitored using analogue pressure gauges. Up to three membranes (of the same size) were used simultaneously.

The feed solution was stirred at \SI{200}{\rpm} with a crescent blade stirrer mounted on a motor (RZR 2051 control, HIG). The minimal volume used was \SIl{0.5}, the maximum volume was \SIl{5.0}. Concentration was facilitated by manually adding more feed to the feed vessel. Diafiltration was facilitated by manually adding more washing solution to the feed vessel and was monitored by conductivity measurements.

Viscous \eps{} solutions were diluted appropriately with ultra-pure water to allow filtration within the pressure limits and sensible Reynolds number regions.
