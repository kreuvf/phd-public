\subsection{Cell Separation}
Harvested fermentation broths were diluted up to ten-fold with ultra-pure water to allow sedimentation of microorganisms. Prior to centrifugation, the diluted broth was shaken vigorously to ensure homogeneity. The diluted broths were centrifuged for \SImin{15} at \SIG{12000} and \SIdC{30}. The supernatant was collected in appropriate vessels and, if not used on the same day, was stored at \SIdC{4} in the dark. Pellets were usually discarded.
