\subsection{High-Throughput \EPS{} Purification\label{hteps-purification}}
Cultures in deep 96-well plates were centrifuged for \SImin{30} at \SIG{3710} and \SIdC{20} (Sorvall RC 6+, TFS). \SIul{200} of supernatant was transferred to a \SIum{1.0} glass fibre filter plate (PC) and the plate centrifuged for \SImin{10} at \SIG{3000} and \SIdC{20}. \SIul{30} of the filtrate was transferred onto a prepared gel filtration plate (Micro SpinColumns, G-25 packing material, HA) and the plate centrifuged for \SImin{2} at \SIG{1000} and \SIdC{20}. At least \SIul{30} of filtrate was gathered in the collection plate.% = no dilution

\paragraph{Preparation of Gel Filtration Plate}
On the day prior to use, the gel filtration plate was washed two times with \SIul{150} of PMP buffer (\SImM{5} ammonium acetate at pH value \num{5.60(5)}) per well by centrifugation for \SImin{2} at \SIG{2000} and \SIdC{20}. An additional \SIul{150} of PMP buffer was added to each well and the plate centrifuged for \SImin{2} at \SIG{1000} and \SIdC{20}. For overnight storage at \SIdC{4}, an additional \SIul{150} of PMP buffer was added to each well and the plate was covered and put into a sealable bag.

On the day of use, the gel filtration plate was washed two times with \SIul{150} of PMP buffer per well by centrifuging for \SImin{2} at \SIG{2000} and \SIdC{20}. An additional \SIul{150} of PMP buffer was added to each well and the plate centrifuged for \SImin{2} at \SIG{1000} and \SIdC{20}. The plate was used thereafter.

After use, the plate was washed three times with \SIul{150} ultra-pure water to remove small molecules by centrifuging for \SImin{2} at \SIG{2000} and \SIdC{20}. For storage, \SIul{100} \SIpct{20} ethanol was added to each well and the plate was covered and put into a sealable bag.
