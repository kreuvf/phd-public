\subsection{Precipitation of Exopolysaccharides\label{subsec-met-precipitation}}
For precipitation, 2-propanol was used as a precipitant at a volumetric ratio of 2:1 (precipitant to \eps{} solution). \EPS{} solutions with a volume of \SIml{500} or more were precipitated by slowly pouring the \eps{} solution into a vessel with the precipitant. During precipitation, the vessel was agitated at \SI{200}{\rpm} with a crescent blade stirrer mounted on a motor (RZR 2051 control, HIG). \EPS{} solutions with a volume between \SIml{50} and \SIml{500} were precipitated by slowly pouring the \eps{} solution into an adequately sized beaker stirred by hand with a spatula. Lower volumes were precipitated in \SIml{50} tubes or \SIml{15} tubes.
