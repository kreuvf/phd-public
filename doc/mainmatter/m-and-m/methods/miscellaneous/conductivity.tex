\subsection{Determination of Conductivity}
Conductivity was measured using a Lab 970 conductivity meter equipped with an LF413T-ID conductivity probe (both SIA). The probe was submerged into the liquid such that the hole was completely covered and no air bubbles remained in it. The measurement was started and after the displayed value had stabilized, it was noted down.
