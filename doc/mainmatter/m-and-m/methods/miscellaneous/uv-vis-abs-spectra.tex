\subsection{Determination of UV/Vis Absorption Spectra}
UV/Vis absorption at single wavelengths or spectra were measured on a photometer (Multiskan Spectrum or Varioskan, TFS) in 96-well plates (F bottom, GBO), PS or PMMA cuvettes (VWR) with a path length \SImm{10} or quartz cuvettes (104.002-QS, HG).
