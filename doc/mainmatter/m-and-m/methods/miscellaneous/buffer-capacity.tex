\subsection{Determination of the Buffer Capacity\label{subsec-bufcap}}
The initial pH value of the analyte, $pH_{0}$, was determined and noted down. A defined amount of the analyte was transferred into a beaker and titrated with \SIM{0.5} \ce{NaOH} to $pH_{1} = pH_{0} + 1$. The amount of substance of sodium hydroxide necessary for the pH shift was divided by the volume of the substance used. The buffer capacity is the result of that division in \si{\milli\mole\per\litre}.
