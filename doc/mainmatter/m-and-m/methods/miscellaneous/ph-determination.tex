\subsection{Determination of pH Value}
pH values were measured using an FE20 pH meter (MTG) and either an InLab Micro Pro pH electrode or an InLab Expert DIN pH electrode (both MTG). If the electrode had not been calibrated on the same day in the desired range, calibration was performed (see \vref{subsec-ph-calib}). Before each measurement, the electrode was rinsed with ultra-pure water and the remaining liquid was dabbed carefully with a tissue. The electrode was lowered into the sample solution and the measurement started. When the signal became stable, the measured value was noted down. After measurement, the electrode was rinsed with ultra-pure water and the remaining liquid was dabbed carefully with a tissue. Then the electrode was lowered into the storage solution.
