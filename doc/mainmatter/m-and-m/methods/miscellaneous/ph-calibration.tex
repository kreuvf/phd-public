\subsection{Calibration of pH Meter\label{subsec-ph-calib}}
The pH meter (FE20 or FG2, MTG) was calibrated using a calibration solution with pH value \num{7.00(2)} and, depending on the desired range, \num{4.00(2)} or \num{10.00(2)}. The electrode was removed from the storage solution and rinsed with ultra-pure water. The remaining liquid was dabbed carefully with a tissue. The electrode was lowered into the calibration solution and the calibration started. After calibration of the first solution, the electrode was rinsed with ultra-pure water and dabbed again and lowered into the next calibration solution. After calibration, the electrode was rinsed with ultra-pure water and the remaining liquid was dabbed carefully with a tissue. Then the electrode was lowered into the storage solution.
