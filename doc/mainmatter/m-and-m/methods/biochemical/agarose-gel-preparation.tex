\subsection{Agarose Gel Preparation\label{gel-prep}}
\nomenclature[chem_TAE]{TAE}{TRIS, acetate, EDTA}
\nomenclature[chem_EDTA]{EDTA}{ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or 2,2$'$,2$''$,2$'''$-(ethane-1,3-diyl\-di\-nitrilo)\-tetra\-acetic acid}
\SIpct{1} agarose in TAE buffer was dissolved by boiling and stored at \SIdC{65} until needed. The gel caster with the tray was levelled using a bubble level. The comb was fixed into the tray and agarose solution was poured into the tray as per requirement. Bubbles were removed using \SIul{1} pipette tips. The gel was let to cool, during which time the electrophoresis chamber (Mini-Sub Cell GT System, BRL) was prepared. Fresh TAE buffer was used and care was taken to cover the whole gel with buffer. In general, \SIrange{3}{5}{\micro\litre} of sample with loading dye was added to one well using a micropipette. Samples containing loading dye were prepared on a small sheet of parafilm by adding the loading dye first and then mixing it with the sample. Then, the whole sample was aspirated and added to the gel.

\paragraph{Loading Dye (\SI{5}{\concfac})}
The loading dye (\SI{5}{\concfac}) contained \SImM{75} Tris, \SImM{50} EDTA, \SIpct{50} glycerol, \SIpct{0.025} bromophenol blue and \SIpct{0.025} xylene cyanol.
