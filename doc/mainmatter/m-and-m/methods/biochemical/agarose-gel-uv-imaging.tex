The destained gel was removed from the destaining solution and viewed using the gel documentation system (Gel iX Imager, IIG). Using the accompanying software (Intas GDS, IIG) image taking parameters were set and the images recorded. Images were saved to the computer in an unmodified form. Histogram equalisation and annotation was performed with the GNU Image Manipulation Program (KMG) afterwards.
