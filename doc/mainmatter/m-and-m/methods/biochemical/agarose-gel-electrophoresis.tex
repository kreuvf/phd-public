\subsection{Agarose Gel Electrophoresis\label{gel-electrophoresis}}
The lid of the electrophoresis chamber was closed carefully and the banana plugs were connected to the banana jacks of the power source. The runs usually lasted for \SIrange{40}{50}{\minute} with a constant voltage of \SI{110}{\volt} and were programmed using a regulated power supply (PowerPac Basic, BRL).
