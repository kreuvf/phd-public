\subsection{Ethidium Bromide Staining}
The staining solution for the ethidium bromide stain was composed of \SIml{250} TAE buffer and five drops of a \SIgpl{10} ethidium bromide solution. After completion of electrophoresis, the tray with the gel was removed from the electrophoresis chamber and the gel was carefully placed in the staining solution for \SImin{20(5)}. In order to remove excess ethidium bromide from the gel, the gel was placed into a destaining solution for at least \SImin{10} afterwards. The destaining solution consisted of \SIml{250} TAE buffer.
