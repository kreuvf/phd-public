\subsection{Agarose Gel Band Cutting}
The agarose gel was prepared as described under \vref{gel-prep}. In addition to the sample(s), one of the outermost lanes called \enquote{sacrificial lane} contained the sample as well. The electrophoresis was conducted as described under \vref{gel-electrophoresis}. Before ethidium bromide staining, the sacrificial lane was cut off the gel using a scalpel and only that lane was subjected to ethidium bromide staining and UV imaging. When UV illuminated, the desired band was marked, the UV light turned off and the remainder of the gel aligned with the sacrificial lane. That way, the bands of the remaining gel were cut out without using either ethidium bromide or UV light minimizing DNA damage. After cutting the bands, the remainder of the gel was subjected to ethidium bromide staining and UV imaging as well to see if all bands were cut out correctly.
