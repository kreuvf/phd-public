pH Behaviour
============
* Strains produce acids
* Block 1: acid consumption phase after pH shift
* Block 2: acid production phase after pH shift
* Times: phases of no pH change, afterwards behaviour as described above; time in h since inoculation

		Behaviour before	pH Behaviour Change Start	pH Behaviour Change End	Behaviour afterwards
F1	acid production	70.5	75.8	acid consumption
F2	acid production	74.0	77.5	acid consumption
F3	acid production	-	-	lagging fermentation, appears to be in change during the end
F4	acid production	68.0	73.7	acid consumption
F5	acid production	55.5	59.3	fluctuating afterwards; since pH = 6.4: acid production (started 5 h 20 min after pH shift), only base needed
F6	acid production	53.5	56.0	fluctuating afterwards; since pH = 6.4: acid production (started 2 h 20 min after pH shift), only base needed
F7	acid production	55.3	59.0	fluctuating afterwards; since pH = 6.4: acid production (started 7 h 40 min after pH shift), only base needed
F8	acid production	59.5	62.0	acid consumption; since pH = 6.4: acid production (started 6 h after pH shift), only base needed
